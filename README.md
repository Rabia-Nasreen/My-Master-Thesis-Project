# Detection of anomaly and identifying contributing features in multivariate time series
Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a critical task in industrial monitoring and predictive maintenance. Recent advances in deep learning have improved the ability to detect anomaly, but accurately identifying contributing features remain challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of such data. As per my research no solution is proposed till now to solve this task. In this work, I performed comparative study of different deep learning models. A comprehensive methodology involving preprocessing, prediction, threshold-based detection, and feature identification is proposed. The project is structured into two key components: (i) detecting anomalous time-steps based on prediction errors, and (ii) identifying the features responsible for those anomalies through an error matrix analysis. Various deep learning models, including FNN, LSTM, FFT-augmented LSTM model, CNN, FFT-augmented CNN model, RNN, Transformer, TCN, and an ensemble deep learning model is compared and evaluated. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are used to benchmark performance across multiple server datasets. The Transformer and LSTM-based models demonstrated superior performance in detecting anomalies, while for feature interpretation LSTM is performing better compared to all other models.
